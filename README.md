# CryptoClustering

The following assignment uses unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The analysis uses the following:
- data scaling
- k-means
- PCA

Resource Folder - Added dataset crypto_market.csv Crypto_Clustering.ipynb - Imported python library pd, pandas,Kmean, PCA,Standardscaler and Kmean. Read dataframe with function pd.read(), Value of statistics with function describe() and plot visualization with hvplot.line(). Data filter with standardscaler() and value of Inertia with filter logic and model.fit() with append result. Cluster data with kmean() and function model.predict () to predict the result of cluster data set. Function PCA.components and PCA.fit_transform(). Define logic to filter result. Visualize with function hvplot.line() to visualize Elow Curve.
